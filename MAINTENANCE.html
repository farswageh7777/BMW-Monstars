      <h2>Maintenance plans for optimal enjoyment :</h2> <br>
      <p id="p10">
Our focus at OffCamber is to keep your car maintained as per the manufacturers <br> 
recommendations so that you can enjoy many trouble free years of peak performance.
<br>
<br>
We start with a baseline of the vital systems in your car including <br>
fluids (engine oil, transmission fluid, differential fluid, brake fluid, and coolant), 
brakes, tires, suspension, drivetrain, HVAC, and engine.  Once your car has a baseline, <br>
 our system will track when the next service is due, and will alert you with an e-mail or text. 
<br>
<br>
Regular maintenance will keep your vehicle running at optimal performance levels, 
 while keeping costly repairs at bay.  When maintenance is ignored, problems build <br>
 up until they damage critical systems, which causes downtime, and expensive repairs. 
<br>
<br>
Our certified automotive technicians use OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) <br>
 or better parts and fluids. <br>

            Once we select and order the perfect tire, we will schedule
             your appointment for the installation. <br>
            
            Our team will use our “No touch” Corghi Artiglio 500
             tire mounting machine, where only soft plastic touches <br>
              your wheels. Other machines use metal clamps, metal
               tire spoons, etc. that can damage your wheels. <br>
                 This amazing machine will mount up to a 32”
